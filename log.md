# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Front-End Development Certification and completed the jQuery section. Also completed the FCC Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts:** I haven't used jQuery for a project outside of school yet, but this refresher reminded me of how easy it is to use. I used a bit of jQuery for the tribute page, but want to try out some animation effects tomorrow.

### Day 2: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Switched over to the Full Stack JavaScript track at TeamTreehouse. Learned about defining variables with const and let, arrow function syntax. Also got a quick refresher on JavaScript and learned a couple new methods like querySelector and querySelectorAll.

**Thoughts:** This is my first time learning about const, let, and arrow function syntax. I understand they help to make JavaScript files smaller and easier to read, but I wonder if this is widely adopted yet? A bit confusing at the moment, but I'm sure it will make more sense as I continue. Feels great to be using JavaScript again though! It makes a bit more sense each time I use it.

### Day 3: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Full Stack JavaScript track at TeamTreehouse. Practiced interacting with the DOM - selecting elements, making changes, and responding to user interaction. 

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel more confident about manipulating the DOM. My mind is already swirling with ideas of what I can use this for!

### Day 4: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 1 of YDKJS and started working on the practice challenge. Writing a program that checks to see how much coffee and donuts you can buy with a certain budget, and whether or not you can afford it based on your wallet balance. I got the main part of the challenge completed and working, even went a little further with it, but still need to rework the layout a bit and finish up the styling. 

**Thoughts:** Excited to get a more thorough understanding of JavaScript! Took me a long time to figure out the challenge, but I still managed to write all the code on my own!

### Day 5: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the practice challenge from yesterday. I styled the page and added some additional functionality that allows user input and kept track of the number of coffee and donuts purchased. Also used a table to show the itemized costs and included some response text that appears after a user submits the form.

**Thoughts:** Had a bit of difficulty getting the correct tax amount to show up on the page, but after some fidgeting, I figured it out. Not too bad overall! Looking forward to some more JavaScript challenges.

### Day 6: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 2 of YDKJS. Also completed the "JavaScript and the DOM" course of the Full Stack JavaScript track of TeamTreehouse, but got a bit stuck with the final coding challenge at the end. 

**Thoughts:** Found the brief overview about closures to be a bit confusing. Hopefully, it will make more sense when I get to the later chapters of YDKJS. Regarding the final coding challenge, I will make another attempt at it tomorrow before sharing my solution. Hopefully, taking a step back and looking at it with fresh eyes will help.

### Day 7: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished YDKJS: Up & Going and read Chapter 1 of YDKJS: Scope & Closures. Completed coding challenge from yesterday!

**Thoughts:** Finally managed to finish that coding challenge! It took me a while to figure out how to update the buttons that show up after each list item, especially after the user rearranges the list. I had to rewrite a lot of the original code, but I think my solution is still clean and easy to read.

### Day 8: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read Chapter 2 of YDKJS: Scope & Closures. Jumped back to FCC and started working on the personal portfolio page project using Bootstrap. Implemented a fixed navbar with a collapsible menu and slowly building out the page elements in HTML.

**Thoughts:** I've been avoiding my portfolio website for way too long! It's about time I work on this, even if it's just a simple 1-page site - I can always add to it later on.
