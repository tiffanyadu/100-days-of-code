# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Front-End Development Certification and completed the jQuery section. Also completed the FCC Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts:** I haven't used jQuery for a project outside of school yet, but this refresher reminded me of how easy it is to use. I used a bit of jQuery for the tribute page, but want to try out some animation effects tomorrow.

### Day 2: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Switched over to the Full Stack JavaScript track at TeamTreehouse. Learned about defining variables with const and let, arrow function syntax. Also got a quick refresher on JavaScript and learned a couple new methods like querySelector and querySelectorAll.

**Thoughts:** This is my first time learning about const, let, and arrow function syntax. I understand they help to make JavaScript files smaller and easier to read, but I wonder if this is widely adopted yet? A bit confusing at the moment, but I'm sure it will make more sense as I continue. Feels great to be using JavaScript again though! It makes a bit more sense each time I use it.

### Day 3: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Full Stack JavaScript track at TeamTreehouse. Practiced interacting with the DOM - selecting elements, making changes, and responding to user interaction. 

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel more confident about manipulating the DOM. My mind is already swirling with ideas of what I can use this for!
