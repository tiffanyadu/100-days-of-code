# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Front-End Development Certification and completed the jQuery section. Also completed the FCC Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts:** I haven't used jQuery for a project outside of school yet, but this refresher reminded me of how easy it is to use. I used a bit of jQuery for the tribute page, but want to try out some animation effects tomorrow.
