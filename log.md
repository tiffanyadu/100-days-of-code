# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Front-End Development Certification and completed the jQuery section. Also completed the FCC Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts:** I haven't used jQuery for a project outside of school yet, but this refresher reminded me of how easy it is to use. I used a bit of jQuery for the tribute page, but want to try out some animation effects tomorrow.

### Day 2: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Switched over to the Full Stack JavaScript track at TeamTreehouse. Learned about defining variables with const and let, arrow function syntax. Also got a quick refresher on JavaScript and learned a couple new methods like querySelector and querySelectorAll.

**Thoughts:** This is my first time learning about const, let, and arrow function syntax. I understand they help to make JavaScript files smaller and easier to read, but I wonder if this is widely adopted yet? A bit confusing at the moment, but I'm sure it will make more sense as I continue. Feels great to be using JavaScript again though! It makes a bit more sense each time I use it.

### Day 3: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Full Stack JavaScript track at TeamTreehouse. Practiced interacting with the DOM - selecting elements, making changes, and responding to user interaction.

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel more confident about manipulating the DOM. My mind is already swirling with ideas of what I can use this for!

### Day 4: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 1 of YDKJS and started working on the practice challenge. Writing a program that checks to see how much coffee and donuts you can buy with a certain budget, and whether or not you can afford it based on your wallet balance. I got the main part of the challenge completed and working, even went a little further with it, but still need to rework the layout a bit and finish up the styling.

**Thoughts:** Excited to get a more thorough understanding of JavaScript! Took me a long time to figure out the challenge, but I still managed to write all the code on my own!

### Day 5: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the practice challenge from yesterday. I styled the page and added some additional functionality that allows user input and kept track of the number of coffee and donuts purchased. Also used a table to show the itemized costs and included some response text that appears after a user submits the form.

**Thoughts:** Had a bit of difficulty getting the correct tax amount to show up on the page, but after some fidgeting, I figured it out. Not too bad overall! Looking forward to some more JavaScript challenges.

### Day 6: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 2 of YDKJS. Also completed the "JavaScript and the DOM" course of the Full Stack JavaScript track of TeamTreehouse, but got a bit stuck with the final coding challenge at the end.

**Thoughts:** Found the brief overview about closures to be a bit confusing. Hopefully, it will make more sense when I get to the later chapters of YDKJS. Regarding the final coding challenge, I will make another attempt at it tomorrow before sharing my solution. Hopefully, taking a step back and looking at it with fresh eyes will help.

### Day 7: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished YDKJS: Up & Going and read Chapter 1 of YDKJS: Scope & Closures. Completed coding challenge from yesterday!

**Thoughts:** Finally managed to finish that coding challenge! It took me a while to figure out how to update the buttons that show up after each list item, especially after the user rearranges the list. I had to rewrite a lot of the original code, but I think my solution is still clean and easy to read.

### Day 8: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read Chapter 2 of YDKJS: Scope & Closures. Jumped back to FCC and started working on the personal portfolio page project using Bootstrap. Implemented a fixed navbar with a collapsible menu and slowly building out the page elements in HTML.

**Thoughts:** I've been avoiding my portfolio website for way too long! It's about time I work on this, even if it's just a simple 1-page site - I can always add to it later on.

### Day 9: February 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read Chapter 3 of YDKJS: Scope & Closures. Finished structuring portfolio page with HTML elements and began adding styles.

**Thoughts:** This page came together a lot quicker than I expected, but I think it really helped that I designed the layout ahead of time. Since I didn't have to make any design decisions on the fly, I was able to put all my focus on the code itself.

### Day 10: February 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished reading YDKJS: Scope & Closures!

**Thoughts:** Didn't have enough time to do any coding today, but hopefully I can make up for it when I get back from NYC.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 010](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/830247615740727296)

### Day 11: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read Chapter 1 of YDKJS: This & Object Prototypes. Also did a bit more styling on the portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** I didn't get much coding done today either since I'm flying out to NYC for a quick vacation. Unfortunately, I think I need to take a break from this while I'm there since it will be difficult to find time to work on anything. I will do my best to make up for it when I get back home though!

### Day 12: February 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on styling my portfolio page again. Styled the typography and buttons with hover animation. Also adjusted the spacing between elements.

**Thoughts:** Took a longer break than I wanted to. I caught a terrible cold on my last day in NYC and am still not feeling great, but wanted to get back on this. Feels good to be coding again, finally!

**Link to tweet:** [Day 012](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/833138859860951044)

### Day 13: February 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the portfolio page. Started styling the navigation and coded a full-cover background image with transparent overlay.

**Thoughts:** I was having problems with Brackets so now I'm trying out Sublime Text. Feeling quite slow as I'm getting familiar with Sublime, but also I really miss having that Live Preview feature. Anyways, just plugging along on the styling. Next step is figuring out how to make the navbar fixed on scroll!

### Day 14: February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Mostly worked on styling the navbar today. Now, after scrolling past the navbar, a class is added to it, giving it some additional styling and making it fixed to the top.

**Thoughts:** It didn't take too long to figure out how I was going to code this part, but I still wasn't quite sure how to write the JavaScript code on my own. It definitely helped a lot to see examples of how other people did it.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 014](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/833909590517489664)

### Day 15: February 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Needed a break from the portfolio page, so I continued with the FreeCodeCamp tutorials. Completed the Basic JavaScript and Object Oriented and Function Programming sections.

**Thoughts:** I started off the day working on the mobile view of the portfolio navigation. Didn't get too much done because I got stuck troubleshooting a bug where the menu items weren't showing up. After I figured out what was wrong, I started adding some styles and switching out classes using JavaScript and jQuery. I realized I was a bit rusty, so I decided to switch over and do some tutorials for the rest of the day.

### Day 16: February 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on the mobile nav styling and functionality, styled all the buttons, and added a Twitter widget to footer. Started building a modal for the contact form.

**Thoughts:** Still finding Bootstrap to be a bit tricky to customize, but luckily most answers are a quick Google search away. Also, feeling a bit more confident with JavaScript and jQuery since I've been working on the functionality of the navigation.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 016](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/834580664079020032)

### Day 17: February 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on the algorithm challenges at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The palindrome challenge really had me stumped! I couldn't quite figure out how to use the replace method and couldn't really make sense of the regular expressions, so I had to go searching for help. When I saw someone else's solution, I was surprised that it was only a few lines of code! Unfortunately, this means I didn't get to solve this challenge on my own. Hopefully my brain will start thinking more like a programmer over time.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 017](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/834857736072470528)

### Day 18: February 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the algorithm challenges + the JSON APIs and AJAX section at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Those algorithm challenges were pretty fun! Definitely helped me get more familiar with some JavaScript methods and exercise my programming problem-solving skills. I only wish I could've created something more useful in the process, but I'm sure that will come later on.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 018](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/835267341122482176)

### Day 19: February 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Styled the project section with hover effects and started working on the contact modal. Also finished the Intro to jQuery course at Treehouse and tested out an After Effects plugin called Bodymovin.

**Thoughts:** Although Bodymovin only allows limited types of animation effects, it's still exciting to see how After Effects can be used in conjunction with front-end development! Since my husband is a motion graphic designer, this might finally give us a chance to collaborate on a project.

### Day 20: February 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the contact form and started coding the resume and project modals. Also ended up changing the button styles.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty frustrated today because I spent so much time trying to fix a bug and getting nowhere with it. Hopefully I can figure something out tomorrow, otherwise I will have to redo that part.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 020](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/836035149179539456)

### Day 21: February 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started writing the About Me copy. Also moved it from the footer to the first section of the page and styled it for each breakpoint.

**Thoughts:** I decided to move the About Me section to the top so the flow of content makes more sense. Still need to rework the portfolio section though since I couldn't figure out how to fix the bug.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 021](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/836415465522151424)

### Day 22: February 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started reworking the portfolio section into a carousel and finished the Git Basics course at Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** I decided it would be a good idea to start using Github for my portfolio project since it's getting pretty big. Since I'm working on some new features, it only makes sense for me to do this so I don't lose my previous code, if I end up changing my mind. Plus, this is a great chance for me to practice version control and using Git with the command line. It's still a tiny bit confusing at the moment, but it should clear up once I start using it more.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 022](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/836696001473888256)

### Day 23: March 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded and styled a carousel for the portfolio section. Also went back to the Tribute page and started adding a fixed nav.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about my progress today! This portfolio carousel is shaping up and is NEARLY done, but I still want to go back and tweak a couple things. Also, since I decided to add the tribute page to my portfolio, I thought it needed a fixed nav since the page was quite long. Will finish up tomorrow!

**Link to tweet:** [Day 023](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/837157960996515842)

### Day 24: March 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the nav for the Tribute page and also fixed a few bugs. On the portfolio page, started working on the project modals' content and styling.

**Thoughts:** I think adding the nav to the Tribute page was great practice for me. Since I wanted the functionality of the nav to be similar to the one I created for my portfolio, doing it a second time really helped to reinforce what I learned the first time around.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 024](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/837473477682675713)

### Day 25: March 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the project modals today. Started creating the content and copy for each project and styled the project modals.

**Thoughts:** Can't believe I'm already a quarter of the way done with this challenge! It's exciting to see my progress, and I'm particularly happy that this motivated me to finally work on my portfolio website. I can't wait to see how much I've learned by the time this hundred days are over!

**Link to tweet:** [Day 025](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/837888488448143361)

### Day 26: March 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an older project for my husband today and spent way too much time trying to fix a bug. Decided to change direction for now so I can keep moving forward.

**Thoughts:** I got super frustrated trying to fix that tiny bug! After fidgeting with the code for over an hour, I decided it wasn't worth my time. I was trying to use Gifffer, a small JavaScript library that prevents animated GIFs from autoplaying, with Bootstrap 4, and couldn't figure out what was causing the extra 5px padding on the bottom of each GIF. Need to find an alternative solution to this, but for now, I just have all the GIFs autoplaying on the page.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 026](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/838202699715907584)

### Day 27: March 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished styling the project modals and started creating/writing content for each project. Also went back to that older project from yesterday to try and figure out the best way to present animated GIFs on a webpage.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm done fidgeting with the project modals for now. I need to constantly remind myself to keep things simple and just get this done ASAP! I can always go back and add to it if I want, but it's much more important that I FINISH my portfolio website so I can finally start applying for jobs.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 027](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/838549020733747200)

### Day 28: March 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Haven't been learning a whole lot lately, so I decided to do some tutorials at Treehouse. Learned about modules and completed the Intro to ES2015 course. Read Chapter 2 of YDKJS Book 3 (this & Object Prototypes) and learned more about how to determine what the "this" keyword is referencing. Also worked on the older project (TMS) again - updated the page to use the latest version of Bootstrap 4 and finally got all the GIFs working the way I wanted (using Gifffer)!

**Thoughts:** Although I can see the advantages of modules and ES2015, I'm not really sure how or when I should be using them - need to learn more! Regarding the TMS project, I'm so happy to finally get the GIFs working and looking good! This is pretty much done for now. The next step is to convert it into a Wordpress theme so my husband can easily update it and add new GIFs himself.

### Day 29: March 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Mostly worked on creating/writing the content for my portfolio today. The project modals are done for now, and I started working on the Resume modal.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited that the end is finally in sight! Only a few more things to do before I can upload and share my portfolio website. There are some extra features I would like to add to it, but I just really need to get a basic website up for now.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 029](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/839350267959259136)

### Day 30: March 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished styling the resume and contact modals. Validated all my code and tried to fix as many errors as possible. Also started the Node.js Basics course at Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** The only thing left to do before I can publish my portfolio site is to make the contact form work! I can't wait to be done with this and start a new project!

**Link to tweet:** [Day 030](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/839664094827409408)

### Day 31: March 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Converted website to use PHP and tried to make it more modular. Trying to make the contact form work.

**Thoughts:** I haven't touched PHP in over a year so I'm feeling pretty rusty. I really love this language though, so it's great to get some practice in right now. Having some difficulties figuring out how to submit the form within a modal, so I'll have to look at it again tomorrow.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 031](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/840049934271422469)

### Day 32: March 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Node.js Basics course at Treehouse and completed the HTTP Basics course since it was recommended. Built out 2 small command line applications: 1 that retrieves info from a Treehouse profile and another that gets the current weather using the Wunderground API. Will pick back up on that contact form tomorrow!

**Thoughts:** It's awesome that I finally got to learn node.js because I see it mentioned everywhere and now I kind of understand what it does! Surprisingly, it's not too difficult so far, but I'm more interested to see what I can do with it outside of the command line.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 032](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/840349971966767104)

### Day 33: March 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a new course on Treehouse called "Building a Simple Dynamic Site with Node.js" and continued working on the contact form functionality.

**Thoughts:** The contact form wasn't submitting correctly with just PHP - I'm thinking it's because the contact form is in a modal? Not too sure, but it seems like I will need to use jQuery and AJAX to get this working so the form submits and shows a success message without needing to refresh the page.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 033](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/840734615669223424)

### Day 34: March 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a Facebook Live template for counting reactions.

**Thoughts:** I'm very interested in how interactive these reaction counters can get. Not too difficult to modify, but it seems difficult to test without having to go live.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 034](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/841051900783009797)

### Day 35: March 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried working on the contact form functionality again, but didn't make much progress.

**Thoughts:** It seems like my modal form doesn't "submit" for some reason, but I was able to get some response when listening for both "submit" AND "click". Slowly getting somewhere, but I think the AJAX code needs more work.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 035](https://twitter.com/dusign/status/841505453406343170)

### Day 36: March 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Joined LambdaSchool's free JavaScript mini bootcamp. Missed the first live stream yesterday, so I caught up on that and watched the second one tonight. Finished the JavaScript exercises for the first assignment and also helped my husband update his website.

**Thoughts:** So far, this mini bootcamp is a bit too easy for me, but it's nice to get a community and to see how the instructor uses Github and Node.js. I was able to complete the first assignment of 25 JavaScript exercises in about 5-10 minutes though, so that makes me feel pretty confident that I at least know the basics.
